                            Hello, my name is Patrick Gerspach and welcome to my portfolio site! I am an aspiring web
                            developer/software engineer who has completely changed the course of his life in pursuit of
                            a more fulfilling and enjoyable career.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I began coding at the University of Notre Dame, where I studied mechanical engineering. My
                            experience started with learning the basics of an archaic programming language called
                            Fortran. From there, pieces of coding began to slip into my coursework through MatLAB and
                            C, and it didn't take me long to desire to learn more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Upon finishing my degree and starting work, I almost immediately signed up for the Columbia
                            University Engineering Coding Boot Camp, which I am set to graduate in March. I have
                            learned an incredible amount in such a short time, and my interest has only grown since the
                            onset of my journey. I hope you enjoy browsing my projects as much as I enjoyed working on
                            them!
